# 42LC
42LC calculator (alpha version)

Remember to use a high speed micro SD card for best results when saving data.

See the 42LCmoreNotes file for how data is saved.  Also 42LCtestPrograms for Hitomezashi and Nqueens test programs

Files test42a05.txt, test42b05.txt, test42c05.txt, test42d05.txt and test42e05.txt will contain the Hitomezashi and Nqueens test programs.  Remember to Load state 05 (see Config menu, below).

For Nqueens, XEQ OO (two letter O's).  Results stored in reg 01 to 04 (for size 4).
For Hitomezashi, you must rescan local labels:  in normal mode, do GTO HT, then enter PRGM mode, and exit PRGM mode (by exiting program mode, local labels are rescanned for the current program).  Remember to store size (<9) in S.

The Config menu (press Shift (kbp) key.  Note, currently, must enter number first, then enter Config menu.

To save a calculator state, enter a number from 1 to 99 on the stack, and press Enter.  Then press the "save" softkey.
To load a calculator state, enter a number from 1 to 99 on the stack and press Enter.  Then the "load" softkey.
If you want to change the "matrix number" variable, put the number (0 to 9) on the stack and press Enter.  Then the "mtnum" softkey.  The next new matrix will have that number.  After 9, mtnum will wrap around back to 0 and may overwrite another matrix if it was stored there.
If you want to change the program count number (useful when doing GTO ..), put the number from 0 to 14 on the stack and press Enter.  Then the "pcount" softkey.

Using GTO .####

It is possible to go to a particular program by doing a GTO .####, where #### is a 4 digit number for the address.  To go to address 99, put GTO .0099  
Entering a number more than 1499 may lead to unpredictable results.
First program is usually 0000 to 0099, second program is usually 0100 to 0199 and so on.
